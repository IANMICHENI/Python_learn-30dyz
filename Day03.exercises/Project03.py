# Day 3: String Intelligence Analyzer


Ask the user to enter two words:

word1

word2

Calculate the length of each word using len()

Convert the lengths:

length → float → string

Check substring presence using in:

Is "on" in both words?

Is "ing" in either word?

Check sentence for word "jargon"

Use in operator on "I hope this course is not full of jargon."

Create a falsy comparison

Compare lengths of two words with a condition that evaluates to False

Check if words start with the same letter

Print all results neatly in a multi-line block using triple quotes """ """.
